# Instructions

# Coding Challenge

## Objective

Create a webpage that manages a home movie collection.

## User Stories

- As a user I want to use the app in the latest version of Chrome.
- As a user I want to be able to enter new movies.
- As a user I want to be able to search existing movies by an arbitrary field.
- As a user I want to be able to see a list of all my movies.
- As a user I want to be able to either DELETE a movie or UPDATE a movie.
  (You must implement at least one.)
- As a user I want to record the following info about any given movie :
  - Genre
  - Actors
  - Title
  - Year
  - Rating

## Technical Requirements

- The page MUST be a single page application (though may have multiple routes and templates).
- The page MUST use ReactJS.
- The page MUST have at least 1 custom React element.
- You MUST use git for version control.
- Bonus points:
  - lodash.js or underscore.js
  - bootstrap.css or equivalent

You MAY use other publicly available JS components (please document separately any frameworks that you choose to use other than the ones listed here).

## Additional Comments

- When you start the challenge, please commit a file to the git repo named "started" with the content being the current date/time.
- Use what you believe to be best practices when developing the page. You will be judged on both the function and the form of your code.
- When you finish, create a git bundle( git bundle create code_challenge.bdl --all).
- Email that bundle to the person who sent you this coding challenge or host it on dropbox and email the link to download it.
